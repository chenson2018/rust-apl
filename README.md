This repo constructs an interpreter for the APL programming language, written in Rust. 

The primary inspiration is from Bob Nystrom's excellent [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

I also have used a significant amount of code from [Emily Signet's implementation of Lox](https://github.com/emily-signet/lax)
